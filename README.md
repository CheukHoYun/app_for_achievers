## This is a single page application created for a job application at Achievers.

The application is under construction, and will be online and running in 48 hours.

The deadline of handing in the application is August.21, I will keep maintaining the project and adding new features until then.

Most work should be done in the first 48-hour sprint, though, since after that there are a lot of interviews and final exams waiting on the timeline.

You can view the current build at: https://cheukhoyun.github.io/app_for_achievers/

### Purpose of this project:

- Demonstrate that the applicant is able to perform full-stack web development.
- Show off the applicant's knowledge about technologies including React, Redux, NodeJS, Bootstrap, etc.
- Show the applicant's ability to gather information, learn new concepts and build stuff in a very short period of time.

### Updates:

- Aug.18 20:00: Added several basic components and applied some css styles.
- Aug.18 21:55: Added a dummy button and a counter, having fun with conditional rendering.
